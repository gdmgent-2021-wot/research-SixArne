# Image restoration

Image restoration is the operation of taking a corrupt/noisy
image and estimating the clean, original image. Corruption may come
in many forms such as motion blur, noise and camera mis-focus.
Image restoration is performed by reversing the process that blurred 
the image and such is performed by imaging a point source and use the 
point source image, which is called the Point Spread Function (PSF) 
to restore the image information lost to the blurring process.
